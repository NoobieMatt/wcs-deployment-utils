        ====================

        README and examples available here: https://github.com/with-watson/wcs-deployment-utils/

        A set of utilities to script common Watson Conversation tasks without using the service tooling.

        These are particularly useful if you need to build or apply changes to a set of Watson Conversation instances in an additive, programmatic, and repeatable way. A few examples of useful situations for these utilities:

        - You want to copy a dialog branch from one workspace to another without overwriting the entire dialog tree
        - You want to merge entity definitions from one workspace to another without overwriting existing entity components
        - You want to build a workspace as a set of modular components. (Workspace 1 uses modules A and C, but workspace 2 uses modules B and C)

        Included functions are:

        -wcs_deployment_utils.dialog.copy_dialog_data: Copy a branch of dialog from a source workspace to a target workspace
        -wcs_deployment_utils.dialog.generate_wcs_diagram: Generates a string representation of target workspace dialog tree
        -wcs_deployment_utils.dialog.delete_branch_from_csv: Iterate through a CSV file and prune dialog tree
        -wcs_deployment_utils.intents.copy_intent_data: Copy intent data from a WCS workspace to a target workspace
        -wcs_deployment_utils.intents.load_csv_as_intent_data: Load intent data from a CSV file to a target workspace
        -wcs_deployment_utils.entities.copy_entity_data: Copy entity data from a WCS workspace to a target workspace
        -wcs_deployment_utils.entities.load_csv_as_entity_data: Load entity data from a CSV file to a target workspace
        -wcs_deployment_utils.util.get_and_backup_workspace: Gets an export of a workspace and stores it locally
